### Life inspired by love and guided by knowledge - Bertrand Russell
I am a research engineer at Hewlett Packard Labs.
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin,
where I worked with Prof. [Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/) in the
[UT Systems and Storage Lab](http://utsaslab.cs.utexas.edu/) and the [LASR](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/lasr/) 
research group. 
I was a recipient of the [2021 Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!fellows).
I received my masters in Computer Science from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/) 
(Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology) and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering 
from [Hongik University](https://en.hongik.ac.kr/index.do), where I worked with Prof. [Sam H. Noh](http://next.unist.ac.kr/professor).

My research aims at designing next-generation systems for emerging memory/storage (e.g., PM, NVM) and disaggregation 
technologies (e.g., RDMA, CXL interconnects). In particular, I have been mainly working on building efficient and reliable 
data-intensive systems for Persistent Memory (PM) and Disaggregated Persistent Memory (DPM). My work ranges from 
system component designs like indexing data structures [[WORT (FAST'17)](https://sekwonlee.github.io/publications/fast17), 
[RECIPE (SOSP'19)](https://sekwonlee.github.io/publications/sosp19_recipe)] to diverse full-system studies,
such as key-value stores [[DINOMO (PVLDB'22)](https://sekwonlee.github.io/publications/vldb23_dinomo)], 
file systems [[PMAL (ISPASS'17)](https://sekwonlee.github.io/publications/ispass17), 
[SplitFS (SOSP'19)](https://sekwonlee.github.io/publications/sosp19_splitfs)], and transaction processing systems 
[[iDO (MICRO'18)](https://sekwonlee.github.io/publications/micro18)] for a local PM setting.

### Life inspired by love and guided by knowledge - Bertrand Russell

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin,
working with Prof. [Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/) in the
[UT Systems and Storage Lab](http://utsaslab.cs.utexas.edu/) and the [LASR](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/lasr/) 
research group. I am also closely working with [Kimberly Keeton](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=wR_tv-kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Sharad Singhal](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=_CKGpJ0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), 
and [Marcos K. Aguilera](http://mkaguilera.kawazoe.org/).
I am a recipient of the [2021 Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/#!fellows).
I received my masters in Computer Science from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/) 
(Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology) and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering 
from [Hongik University](https://en.hongik.ac.kr/index.do), where I worked with Prof. [Sam H. Noh](http://next.unist.ac.kr/professor).

I am broadly interested in improving the performance and reliability of storage/file systems, operating systems, 
distributed systems, and database systems. Especially, my recent studies focus on building systems for 
Persistent Memory (PM) and its disaggregation. Currently, I am studying design issues of an elastic, high-performance, 
scalable, and crash recoverable key-value store for Disaggregated Persistent Memory (DPM) based on RDMA and CXL interconnects.

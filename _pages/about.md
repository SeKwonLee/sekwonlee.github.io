I am a researcher at HPE Labs. My research interest lies in next-generation systems for emerging
memory/storage and disaggregation technologies.
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin,
where I worked with Prof. [Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/). 
I received my masters in Computer Science from UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology) 
and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Hongik University, where I worked with 
Prof. [Sam H. Noh](https://next.cs.vt.edu/professor/).

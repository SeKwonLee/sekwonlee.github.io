I am a researcher at HPE Labs. My research interest lies in next-generation systems for emerging
memory/storage and disaggregation technologies.
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin,
where I worked with Prof. [Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/) in the
[UT Systems and Storage Lab](http://utsaslab.cs.utexas.edu/) and the [LASR](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/lasr/) 
research group. 
I received my masters in Computer Science from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/) 
(Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology) and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering 
from [Hongik University](https://en.hongik.ac.kr/index.do), where I worked with Prof. [Sam H. Noh](http://next.unist.ac.kr/professor).
